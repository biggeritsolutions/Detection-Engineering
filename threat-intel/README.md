# Threat Intelligence Reports

Demonstration Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports produced as portfolio artifacts.
All reports are clearly marked `[DEMO]` and use fictional threat actors, infrastructure,
and campaign details based on documented public malware behavior.

Each report follows a professional CTI structure including:

- Executive summary with risk scoring
- Threat actor profile and campaign timeline
- Full MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) with confidence levels
- Detection content: Sigma rules, YARA rules, KQL queries
- Mitigations mapped to CIS Controls v8 and NIST CSF 2.0
- Structured confidence assessment methodology
